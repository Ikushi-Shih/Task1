# Task1

This is a script to generate given random number following a given distribution.

# How to use (Python 3)
There are two inputs : _random_nums / _probabilities.

#### Random Numbers
_random_nums are the number to return.

```sh
_random_nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
```
It is defaulted as [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3] and you can change any number you want.


#### Probabilities
_probabilities are the distribution of the given set of random numbers.

```sh
_probabilities = [0.01, 0.3, 0.58, 0.1, 0.01]
```
It is defaulted as [0.01, 0.3, 0.58, 0.1, 0.01] and you can change any number you want.
Make sure the list has the same amount to the set of random number and sum to 1.
